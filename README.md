# form-pattern (Generator formularzy sieciujący komisje związków zawodowych)

A full stack application that enables the creation of voting forms in workplaces, serving as a contact database for other trade union commisions undertaking similar activities, and also as an archive of protocols from collective disputes.

Union activists can register by app admin to gain moderator privileges.

A moderator after logging in can:

- Generate voting forms available under a unique public URL,
- Collect responses from employees,
- Access all submitted data in their moderator account,
- Export collected results into PDF format for reporting and archiving.

The application was developed with grant support received in the grant competition under the project “TransferHub – Incubator of Social Innovations in the Field of Employment.” The grant project is implemented by the Foundation for Socio-Economic Initiatives in partnership with the “Technological Incubator” Foundation (Youth Business Poland) as part of the European Funds for Social Development 2021–2027 Program, co-financed by the European Social Fund Plus. The innovation was developed within the TransferHub Incubator.
