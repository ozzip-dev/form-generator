### Generator formularzy sieciujący komisje związków zawodowych
A platform built to support trade union organizations with digital tools for collaboration, voting, and knowledge sharing. This full-stack application empowers trade union activists by providing:
- Voting forms – easily create and share workplace voting forms available under a unique link.
- Contact database – maintain a network of other trade union commissions engaged in similar initiatives.
- Archive – securely store and access protocols from collective disputes.
- Discussion forum – connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate with fellow union members.

<br/>
<br/>
Union activists can register by app admin to gain moderator privileges. A moderator after logging in can:

- Generate voting forms available under a unique public URL,
- Collect responses from employees,
- Access all submitted data in their moderator account,
- Export collected results into PDF format for reporting and archiving.

<br/>
The application was developed with grant support received in the grant competition under the project “TransferHub – Incubator of Social Innovations in the Field of Employment.” The grant project is implemented by the Foundation for Socio-Economic Initiatives in partnership with the “Technological Incubator” Foundation (Youth Business Poland) as part of the European Funds for Social Development 2021–2027 Program, co-financed by the European Social Fund Plus. The innovation was developed within the TransferHub Incubator.
