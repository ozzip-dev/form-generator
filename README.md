# form-pattern (Generator formularzy sieciujący komisje związków zawodowych )

An full stack application that enables the creation of voting forms in workplaces, serving as a contact database for other trade union commisions undertaking similar activities, and also as an archive of protocols from collective disputes.

Union activists can register by app admin to gain moderator privileges.

A moderator can:

- Generate voting forms available under a unique public URL,
- Collect responses from employees,
- Access all submitted data in their moderator account,
- Export collected results into PDF format for reporting and archiving.

The application was developed as part of the Transferhub grant program.
